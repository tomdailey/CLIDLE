# CLIDLE
CLIDLE is a **C**ommon **L**isp **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment and **L**earning **E**nvironment
for Common Lisp beginners.

## Why?
There are *several* other Common Lisp focused IDE's and editors with amazing capabilities out there
already. For example, Emacs + SLIME, SLIMA on Atom editor, VLime, etc. However, I personally don't
think they are Lisp *beginner* friendly.

I still remember when I first encounter CL and introduced to SLIME. It wasn't
a fun experience to get everything ready and using a text editor and direct lisp client weren't
enjoyable either.

My idea is to create a similar small tool like Python's IDLE (which is amazing for the actual purpose)
and can be easily used out of the box.

## Goals
- [ ] Out of the box usage, simple, and easy to use
- [x] Project/package focused environment
- [ ] Ability to compile and load the project and view
the changes interactively

## Supported Platform
- Linux kernel based operating systems only

## Development Status
Abandoned

## Dependencies (for development)
* A lisp implementation with quicklisp already set up
* wish/tcl/tk
* Internet connection to download the dependencies
